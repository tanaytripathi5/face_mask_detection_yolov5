# face_mask_detection_yolov5
Using object detection with yolov5 to predict if people are wearing masks or not from images or video. Yolov5 verison has been used which is fast and accurate. The code can be edited to change the version of yolov5 between yolov5s,m,l and x. The number of parameters and accuracy increase repectively. The model can work on both images as well as videos.
The dataset is obtained from kaggle and hand labelled to get it in the yolo format. The data et was preprocessed and uploaded using roboflow for easier access.
link can be obtained from roboflow on the custom dataset. Or you can use mine if it helps you just replace the ['Your link here'] by the link.
Heres a link to my dataset. - https://app.roboflow.com/ds/2OekMnTj1E?key=4r2V36AtQs.
The repository also contains the best saved weights from yolov5x model trained by me for direct use - best(1).pt
